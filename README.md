# sports-ticker
A simple python sports ticker

I'm working on making a simple sports ticker using python

It's going to be crude, and eventually go on a 
raspberry pi and a monitor

UPDATE 2019-07-31: This code currently works on a Windows platform and a Rasperian platform. Written in Python 3. No modules need to be download (ie. "import [module]" statement all currently work with standard Python installation)
